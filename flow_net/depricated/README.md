This is a personal reimplementation of LiteFlowNet [1] using PyTorch. Should you be making use of this work, please cite the paper accordingly. Also, make sure to adhere to the <a href="https://github.com/twhui/LiteFlowNet#license-and-citation">licensing terms</a> of the authors. Should you be making use of this particular implementation, please acknowledge it appropriately [2].

## setup
The correlation layer is implemented in CUDA using CuPy, which is why CuPy is a required dependency. It can be installed using `pip install cupy` or alternatively using one of the provided binary packages as outlined in the CuPy repository.

## usage
To run it on your own pair of images, use the following command. You can choose between three models, please make sure to see their paper / the code for more details.

```
python run.py --model default --first ./images/first.png --second ./images/second.png --out ./out.flo
```

I am afraid that I cannot guarantee that this reimplementation is correct. However, it produced results pretty much identical to the implementation of the original authors in the examples that I tried. There are some numerical deviations that stem from differences in the `DownsampleLayer` of Caffe and the `torch.nn.functional.interpolate` function of PyTorch. Please feel free to contribute to this repository by submitting issues and pull requests.
